W2: Simple web notes
====================

Design Goals
------------

1. Extremely compact (only a few PHP files and a CSS file)
2. Minimal execution time, for quickest possible mobile access (iPhone!)
3. Very simple, easy-to-read code
4. Elegant markup syntax for notes, with linking and image support
5. Easily customizable appearance via CSS
6. Storage as plain text files (no database required)
7. Generates clean XHTML output in most cases


Installation
------------

1. Create a directory for W2 somewhere in your web server's document 
   root path.  It doesn't matter where.  W2 requires PHP 4 or higher.
   
2. Upload the W2 files to this directory.  When you're done, it should
   look something like this:
   
   w2/
       config.php
       images/
       index.css 
       index.php
       markdown.php
       pages/
           Home.txt
           Markdown Syntax.txt
       README.txt
       
3. Make sure that the "images" and "pages" directories are writable by your
   web server process.
   
4. You may or may not need to edit config.php.  When you're ready, look in
   there for many additional configuration options.

You should now be ready to access your W2 installation.


Basic Usage
-----------

While viewing a page:

  [Edit] edits the current page content.

  [New] creates a brand new page for you to edit.

  [Upload] allows you to upload an image to the images/ directory for later
  use with the {{image}} tag.  (see "Editing Syntax" below for more info)

  [All] shows you a list of all pages.
  
  [Recent] shows you a list of pages, most recently edited first.

  [Home] returns you to the Home page.

  The search box performs a very simple brute-force search of the contents 
  of all pages.


Editing Syntax
--------------

Please refer to the Markdown Syntax:

  <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax>

Two additional syntax features have been added:

  [[Page Name]] 
      Double square brackets will insert a link to the named page.
      
  {{ImageName.jpg}}
      Double curly brackets will insert the named image from the 
      images/ directory.


Optional Configuration
----------------------

The file config.php contains many options for you to customize your W2 setup.

A few examples:

The following line in config.php may be changed if you do not want the 
default page to be named 'Home':

  define('DEFAULT_PAGE', 'Home');

The following line in config.php may be changed if you'd like to use a
different CSS stylesheet:

  define('CSS_FILE', 'index.css');

The size of the edit textarea is controlled by:

  define('EDIT_ROWS', 18);

W2 has the ability to prompt for a password before allowing access to the
site.  Two lines in config.php control this:

  define('REQUIRE_PASSWORD', false);
  define('W2_PASSWORD', 'secret');

Set REQUIRE_PASSWORD to true and set W2_PASSWORD to the password you'd like
to use.
